Issue should take the form of multiple prompts, but use commands for substrituion of values into prompts. Something like {file:slice} or something similar to inject code into the prompt context.

Each line is a prompt and can be thought of as the transformation from one file state to another.

Additionally needs some sort of method of taking what is generated and inserting it into a file.

# Example issue description

Generate some code > file_path 

> Some code is generated and the result is persisted into file system so that the next prompt/issue line can use it.

Modify the following code to create a skeleton method X: {file_path} > file_path

> The generated code is further modified with some new logic and persisted

Possible idea for generation is the ability to set variables from responses. Instead of passing a file_path to the end clause, one could pass a variable name and later use it in following prompt operations.

# Open questions:

- How should I handle inline code comments on PRs?
- Should I generate PRs via issue description updates exclusively or should I be flexible and support a variety of inputs?
  - If so, should I just make the issue description approach first and modularize it into a library to make it easier to reimplement elsewhere?
