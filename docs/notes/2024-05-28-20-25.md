# Finalizing prompt templating approach

### Creating or updating a variable

```
variable_name = "Create a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome and False otherwise."
```

> Sets variable `variable_name` to the output of prompt `"Create a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome and False otherwise."`.

---

### Utilizing variable

```
variable_one = "Modify the following code to check if the palidrome is also of even length. {variable_name}"
```

> Sets variable `variable_one` to the output of the prompt `"Modify the following code to check if the palidrome is also of even length. {variable_name}"` after substituting {variable_name} with the output of the example above.

---

### Writing output to a file

```
"Create a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome and False otherwise." > file_path.txt
```

> Writes the output of prompt `"Create a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome and False otherwise."` to a file with path and extension `file_path.txt`.

---

### Importing a file into prompt

```
"Modify the following code. Near the end of the file, create a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome and False otherwise. {file_path.txt}" > file_path.txt
```

> Injects the contents of a file `file_path.txt` into the prompt and saves the result to file with path and extension `file_path.txt`.
